# Week 4

**Polymorphism**

- Ability for an object to have different "forms" depending on the context
- Example: Area ( ) function
Rectangle, area = `base * height`
Triangle, area = `0.5 * base * height`
- **Identical** at a high level of abstraction
- **Different** at a low level of abstraction

These things are the same at the high level of extraction. But underneath they're different.

**Inheritance**

- Subclass inherits the methods/data of the superclass

**Overriding**

- Subclass redefines a method inherited from the superclass
- Example: Speaker, Cat, Dog
- Speaker Speak () prints "<noise>"
- Cat Speak () prints "meow"
- Dog Speak () prints "woof"
- Speak ( ) is polymorphic
- Different implementations for each class

## **Interfaces**

- Set of method signatures
- Name, parameters, return values
- Implementation is NOT defined
- Used to express conceptual similarity between types
- Example: Shape2D interface
- All 2D shapes must have Area () and Perimeter ()

**Satisfying an Interface**

- Type satisfies an interface if type defines **all methods** specified in the interface
- Same method signatures
- Rectangle and Triangle types satisfy the Shape2D interface
- Must have Area () and Perimeter () methods
- Additional methods are OK
- Similar to inheritance with overriding

**Defining an Interface Type**

```go
type Shape2D interface {
	Area () float64
	Perimeter () float64
}

type Triangle {...}
func (t Triangle) Area () float64 (...)
func (t Triangle) Perimeter () float64 {...)
```

- Triangle type satisfies the Shape2D interface

**Interface Values**

- Can be treated like other values
- Assigned to variables
- Passed, returned
- Interface values have two components
    1. **Dynamic Type:** Concrete type which it is assigned to
    2. **Dynamic Value:** Value of the dynamic type

**Interface with Nil Dynamic Value**

- An interface can have a nil dynamic value

    ```go
    var s1 Speaker
    var d1 * Dog
    s1 = di
    ```

- `d1` has no concrete value yet
- `s1` has a dynamic type but no dynamic value

    ---

- Can still call the Speak () method of s1
- Doesn't need a dynamic value to call
- Need to check inside the method

**Nil Interface Value**

- Interface with nil dynamic type E.g.: `var sl Speaker`
- Canot call a method, runtime error

**Ways to Use an Interface**

And basically, an interface in this way, it sort of generalizes, right? It hides the details of the differences between the types

- Need a function which takes multiple types of parameter
- Function foo () parameter
- Type X or type Y
- Define interface Z
- `foo ()` parameter is interface Z
- Types X and Y satisfy Z
- Interface methods must be those needed by `foo()`

**Empty Interface**

- Empty interface specifies no methods
- All types satisfy the empty interface
- Use it to have a function accept any type as a parameter

    ```go
    func PrintMe (val interface{}){
    	fmt. PrintIn (val)
    }
    ```

**Type Assertions for Disambiguation**

- Type assertions can be used to determine and extract the underlying concrete type

    ```go
    func DrawShape (s Shape2D) bool {
    	rect, ok := s. (Rectangle)
    	if ok {
    		DrawRect (rect)
    	}
    	tri, ok := s. (Triangle)
    	if ok {
    		DrawRect (tri)
    	}
    }
    ```
