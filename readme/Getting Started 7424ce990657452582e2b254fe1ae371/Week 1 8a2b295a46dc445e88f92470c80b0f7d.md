# Week 1

**Advantages of Go**

1. Code runs fast
2. Garbage collection
3. Simpler objects

**Software Translation**

- Machine language: CPU instructions represented in binary
- Assembly language: CPU instructions with mnemonics
    - Easier to read
    - Equivalent to machine language
- High-level language: Commonly used languages (C, C++, Java, Python, Go, etc.)
- Much easier to use

**Parallelism**

Difficulties with parallelism

- When do tasks start/stop?
- What if one task needs data from another task?

**Concurrent Programming**

- Concurrency is the management of multiple tasks at the same time
- Key requirement for large systems Concurrent programming enables parallelism
    - Management of task execution
    - Communication between tasks
    - Synchronization between tasks

**Concurrency in Go**

- Go includes concurrency primitives
- Goroutines represent concurrent tasks
- Channels are used to communicate between tasks
- Select enables task synchronization
- Concurrency primitives are efficient and easy to use

**Type Declarations**

- Defining an alias (alternate name) for a type
- May improve clarity
    - `type Celsius float 64`
    - `type IDnum int`
- Can declare variables using the type alias
    - `var temp Celsius`
    - `var pid IDnum`
