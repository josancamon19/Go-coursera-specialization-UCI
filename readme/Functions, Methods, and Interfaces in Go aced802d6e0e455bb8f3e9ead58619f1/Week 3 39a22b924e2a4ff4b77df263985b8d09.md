# Week 3

**Classes**

- Collection of data fields and functions that share a well-defined responsibility
- Example: Point class
- Used in a geometry program
- Data: x coordinate, y coordinate
- Functions:
 `DistTo0rigin(), Quadrant ()
 AddX0ffset (), AddY0ffset ()
 SetX(), SetY()`
- Classes are a template
- Contain **data fields**, not data

**Encapsulation**

- Data can be protected from the programmer
- Data can be accessed only using methods
- Maybe we don't trust the programmer to keep data consistent

**Support for classes**

Remember, that's what a class really is, a class is a bunch of data associated with a bunch of methods that operate on the data

**Associating Methods with Data**

- Method has a receiver type that it is associated with
- Use dot notation to call the method

**Controlling Access**

- Can define public functions to allow access to hidden data

    ```go
    package data
    var x int= 1
    func PrintX() {fmt. Println (x)}
    ```

    ```go
    package main
    import "data"
    func main () {
    	data.PrintX()
    }
    ```

- Hide fields of structs by starting field name with a **lower-case letter**
- Define public methods which access hidden data

    ```go
    package data
    type Point struct{
    	x float64
    	y float64
    }

    func (p *Point) InitMe (xn, yn float64) {
    	// allowing to modify X and Y even without access to those variables
    	p.x = xn
    	p.y = yn
    }
    ```

**Pointer receivers**

- Receiver can be a pointer to a type
- Call by reference, pointer is passed to the method

    ```go
    func (p *Point) OffsetX(v float 64){
    	p. X = p. + v
    }
    ```

- No Need to Dereference

**Using Pointer Receivers**.

- Good programming practice:
    1. All methods for a type have pointer receivers, or
    2. All methods for a type have non-pointer receivers
- Mixing pointer/non-pointer receivers for a type will get confusing
- Pointer receiver allows modification
