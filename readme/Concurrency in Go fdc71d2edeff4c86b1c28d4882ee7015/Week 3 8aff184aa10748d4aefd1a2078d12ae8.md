# Week 3

**Creating a Goroutine**

- One goroutine is created automatically to execute the `main()`
- Other goroutines are created using the go keyword

1. Main goroutine blocks on call to `foo()`

1. New goroutine created for `foo()`
- Main goroutine does not block

**Exiting a Goroutine**

- A goroutine exits when its code is complete
- When the main goroutine is complete, all other goroutines exit
- A goroutine may not complete its execution because main completes early

    - Only "Main routine" is printed
    - Main finished before the new goroutine started

**Timing with Goroutines**

- Adding a delay to wait for a goroutine **is bad!** E.g**:** `time.Sleep(time.Second)`

**Synchronization**

Every time we use synchronization, we are reducing the efficiency, we're reducing the amount of possible concurrency. So we're reducing the options for the scheduler so the scheduler won't be able to use the hardware as well as effectively.

- Using **global events** whose execution is viewed by all threads, simultaneously
- **GLOBAL** **EVENT** is viewed by all tasks at the same time
- Synchronization is used to restrict bad interleavings

    Print must occur after update of x

### **Sync WaitGroup**

- Sync package contains functions to synchronize between goroutines
- sync.WaitGroup forces a goroutine to wait for other goroutines
- Contains an internal counter
- Increment counter for each goroutine to wait for
- Decrement counter when each goroutine completes

    ![Week%203%208aff184aa10748d4aefd1a2078d12ae8/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_7.06.12_AM.png](Week%203%208aff184aa10748d4aefd1a2078d12ae8/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_7.06.12_AM.png)

    - `Add()` increments the counter
    - `Done()` decrements the counter
    - `Wait()` blocks until counter == 0

**Goroutine Communication**

- Goroutines usually work together to perform a bigger task
- Often need to send data to collaborate
- Example: Find the product of 4 integers 
- Make 2 goroutines, each multiplies a pair
- Main goroutine multiplies the 2 results
- Need to send ints from main routine to the two sub-routines
- Need to send results from sub-routines back to main routine

**Channels**

- Transfer data between goroutines
- Channels are typed
- Use `make()` to create a channel `c := make (chan int)`
- Send and receive data using the `<-` operator
- Send data on a channel `c ← 3`
- Receive data from a channel `X := ← C`

**Example:**

```go
func prod (v1 int, v2 int, c chan int) { c <-  v1 *v2 }
func main () {
	c := make (chan int)
	go prod (1, 2, c)
	go prod(3, 4, c)
	a := <- C
	b : = <- C
	fmt.Println(a*b)
}
```

**Unbuffered Channel**

- Unbuffered channels cannot hold data in transit
- Default is unbuffered
- Sending **BLOCKS** until data is receive
- Receiving **BLOCKS** until data is sent

**Blocking and Synchronization**

- Channel communication is synchronous
- Blocking is the same as waiting for communication
- Receiving and ignoring the result is same as a Wait ()

    ![Week%203%208aff184aa10748d4aefd1a2078d12ae8/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_9.06.15_AM.png](Week%203%208aff184aa10748d4aefd1a2078d12ae8/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_9.06.15_AM.png)

**Channel Capacity**

- Channels can contain a limited number of objets
- Default size 0 (unbuffered)
- Capacity is the number of objects it can hold in transit
- Optional argument to make() defines channel capacity
- `c := make (chan int, 3)`
- Sending only blocks if buffer is full
- Receiving only blocks if buffer is empty

    So, if the buffer is full, it has three objects in it, you can do three receives without any send because it can receive those three things that are in the buffer.

**Use of Buffering**

- Sender and receiver do not need to operate at exactly the same speed
