# Week 1

**Abstraction**

- Details are hidden in the function
- Only need to understand operations
- Improves understandability

    ```go
    func FindPupil {
    	GrabImage ()
    	FilterImage()
    	FindEllipses()
    }
    ```

**Call by Value**

- Passed arguments are copied to parameters
- Modifying parameters has no effect outside the function

**Tradeoffs of Call by Value**

- Advantage: Data Encapsulation
- Function variables only changed inside the function
- Disadvantage: Copying time
- Large objects may take a long time to copy

**Call by Reference**

- Programmer can pass a pointer as an argument
- Called function has direct access to caller variable in memory

**Tradeoffs of Call by Reference**

- Advantage: Copying Time
- Don't need to copy arguments
- Disadvantage: Data Encapsulation
- Function variables may be changed in called functions
- May be what you want
- Sort an array

**Pass Slices Instead**

- Slices contain a pointer to the array
- Passing a slice copies the pointer

```go
func foo (sli int) int {
	sli[0] = sli[0] + 1
}

func main ( ) {
	a := []int {1, 2, 3}
	foo(a)
	fmt.Print(a)
	// a variable will be updated in place
}
```

## Functions

**Understandability**

- Code is functions and data
- If you are asked to find a feature, you can find it quickly
- "Where is the function that blurs the image?"
- "Where do you compute the average score?"
- If you are asked about where data is used, you know
"Where do you modify the record list?"

**Debugging Principles**

Code crashes inside a function

Two options for the cause

1. Function is written incorrectly 
    - Sorts a slice in the wrong order
2. Data that the function uses is incorrect
    - Sorts slice correctly but slice has wrong elements in it

**Supporting Debugging**

- Functions need to be understandable
    - Determine if actual behavior matches desired behavior
- Data needs to be traceable
    - Where did that data come from?
    - Global variables complicate this

**Function Naming**

> I can just look at the name and say, "Ah that's what it is"

- Give functions a good name
    - Behavior can be understood at a glance
    - Parameter naming counts too

**Functional Cohesion**

- Function should perform only one "operation"
- An "operation" depends on the context

**Few Parameters**

- Debugging requires tracing function input data
- More difficult with a large number of parameters
- Function may have bad functional cohesion

**Reducing Parameter Number**

May need to group related arguments into structures

- `TriangleArea()`, bad solution
    - 3 points needed to define triangle
    - Each point has 3 floats (in 3D)
    - Total, 9 arguments
- `TriangleArea()`, good solution
    - `type Point struct (x, y, z float}`

**Function Complexity**

- Function length is the most obvious measure
- Functions should be simple
- Easier to debug

**Function Length**

- How do you write complicated code with simple functions?
- Function Call Hierarchy

    ```go
    func a(){
    	b()
    	c()
    }
    ```

**Control-flow Complexity**

- Control-flow describes conditional

    ```go
    func foo () {
    	if a == 1 {
    		if b == 1 {
    			// .... code
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

- 3 control-flow paths
- Partitioning conditionals
