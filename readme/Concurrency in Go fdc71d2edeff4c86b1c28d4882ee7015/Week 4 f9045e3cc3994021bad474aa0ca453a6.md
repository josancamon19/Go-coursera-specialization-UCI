# Week 4

**Iterating Through a Channel**

- Common to iteratively read from a channel

```go
for i := range C {
	fmt. Println(i)
}
```

- Continues to read from channel c
- One iteration each time a new value is received
- `i` is assigned to the read value

**Receiving from Multiple Goroutines**

- Multiple channels may be used to receive from multiple sources
- Data from both sources may be needed
- Read sequentially

**Select statement**

- Sometimes you got a Goroutine which can read from different channels, but it doesn't have to read from all of them, it just needs one of them.
- May have a choice of which data to use
- i.e. First-come first-served
- Use the `select` statement to wait on the first data from a set of channels

    ```go
    select {
    	case a = <- cl:
    		fmt.Println(a)
    	case b = <- c2:
    		fmt.Println(b)
    }
    ```

**Select Send or Receive**

- May select either send or receive operations

    ```go
    select {
    	case a = <- inchan:
    		fmt.Println("Received a")
    	case outchan <- b:
    		fmt.Println("sent b")
    }
    ```

**Select with an Abort Channel**

- Use select with a separate abort channel
- May want to receive data until an abort signal is received

    ![Week%204%20f9045e3cc3994021bad474aa0ca453a6/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_9.47.15_AM.png](Week%204%20f9045e3cc3994021bad474aa0ca453a6/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_9.47.15_AM.png)

**Default Select**

If none of those other cases are satisfied, then I will execute the default, so I won't wait, I won't block at all in this case

- May want a default operation to avoid blocking

    ```go
    select {
    	case a = <- cl:
    		fmt. Println(a)
    	case b = <- c2:
    		fmt. Println(b)
    	default:
    		fmt. Println ("nop")
    }
    ```

**Goroutines Sharing Variables**

- Sharing variables concurrently can cause problems
- Two goroutines writing to a shared variable can interfere with each other

    Concurrency-Safe

    â†’ Function can be invoked concurrently without interfering with other goroutines

**Granularity of Concurrency**

Concurrency is at the machine code level

- Concurrency is at the machine code level `i = i + 1` might be three machine instructions

    ![Week%204%20f9045e3cc3994021bad474aa0ca453a6/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_9.52.19_AM.png](Week%204%20f9045e3cc3994021bad474aa0ca453a6/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_9.52.19_AM.png)

- Interleaving machine instructions causes unexpected problems
- 2 goroutines reading the same variable at same interleavings
- 1st adds + 2, 2nd adds + 3
- When writing only 1 of the both additions will be observed

**Correct Sharing**

- Don't let 2 goroutines write to a shared variable at the same time!
- Need to restrict possible interleavings
- Access to shared variables cannot be interleaved

**Mutual Exclusion**

- Code segments in different goroutines which cannot execute concurrently
- Writing to shared variables should be mutually exclusive

**Sync. Mutex Methods**

- `Lock()` method puts the flag up
- Shared variable in use
- If lock is already taken by a goroutine, `Lock ()` blocks until the flag is put down
- `Unlock()` method puts the flag down
- Done using shared variable
- When `Unlock()` is called, a blocked `Lock()` can proceed

**Synchronous Initialization**

- Initialization
- must happen once
- must happen before everything else
- How do you perform initialization with multiple goroutines?
- Could perform initialization before starting the goroutines

**Sync.Once**

- Has one method, once. Do (f)
- Function f is executed only one time
- Even if it is called in multiple goroutines
- All calls to once. Do () block until the first returns
- Ensures that initialization executes first

**Synchronization Dependencies**

- Synchronization causes the execution of different goroutines to depend on each other

    ![Week%204%20f9045e3cc3994021bad474aa0ca453a6/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_10.03.04_AM.png](Week%204%20f9045e3cc3994021bad474aa0ca453a6/Screen_Shot_2020-11-16_at_10.03.04_AM.png)

**Deadlock**

- Circular dependencies cause all involved goroutines to block
- G1 waits for G2
- G2 waits for G1
- Can be caused by waiting on channels

    So, this type of circular dependency where G1 waits for G2 and G2 waits for G1, that's what you need to avoid in your code.

**Deadlock Detection**

- Golang runtime automatically detects when all goroutines are deadlocked
- Cannot detect when a subset of goroutines are deadlocked
