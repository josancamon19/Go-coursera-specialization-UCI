# Week 3

**Arrays**

- Fixed-length series of elements of a chosen type
- Elements accessed using subscript notation, `[]`
- Indices start at 0
- Elements initialized to zero value

    ```go
    var x[5] int
    x[0] = 2
    fmt.Printf(x[1])
    ```

**Array Literal**

- An array pre-defined with values
`var x [5] int[5]{1, 2, 3,4,5}`
- Length of literal must be length of array
- ... for size in array literal infers size from number of initializers

    `X := [...]int {1, 2, 3, 4}`

**Slices**

- A "window" on an **underlying array**
- Variable size, up to the whole array
- **Pointer** indicates the start of the slice
- **Length** is the number of elts in the slice
- **Capacity** is maximum number of elts
    - From start of slice to end of array

**Make**

- Create a slice (and array) using `make ()`
- 2-argument version:
specify type and length/capacity
- Init. to zero, length = capacity
`sli = make ([]int, 10)`
- 3-argument version: specify length and capacity separately
`sli = make ( []int, 10, 15)`

**Append**

- Size of a slice can be increased by
append ()
- Adds elements to the end of a slice
- Inserts into underlying array
- Increases size of array if necessary
`sli = make ( []int, 0,3)`
- Length of sli is 0
`sli = append (sli, 100)`

**Struct**

**Example: Person Struct**

- Name, Address, phone
- Option 1: Have 3 separate variables, programmer remembers that they are related
- Option 2: Make a single struct which contains all 3 vars

For bringing together different variables that are related in the application and putting them together so that you, as a programmer, know that they are related and they're related to the same

Initializing Structs

- Can use `new()`
- Initializes fields to zero
`pl := new (Person)`
- Can initialize using a struct literal
pl := Person (name:"joe",addr: "a st.",phone: 
"123")
