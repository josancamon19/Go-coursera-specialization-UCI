Moore Law

Basically says every 2 years the number of transistors gets doubled

1. increase density, lead to increase power consumption on the chip, and increase the temperature which will melt the chip
2. Dennard scaling can’t continue forever, voltage can’t go too low because:
3. Voltage swing need to be higher than the threshold voltage of the transistor.
4. Need keep noise tolerant
5. Leakage power increase over time
