# Week 2

**Pointers**

- A pointer is an address to data in memory
- `*` operator returns data at an address (dereferencing)
- `&` operator returns the address of a variable/function

**New**

- Alternate way to create a variable
- `new()` function creates a variable and returns a pointer to the variable
- Variable is initialized to zero

    `ptr : = new (int)
    *ptr = 3`

**Deallocating Space**

- When a variable is no longer needed,
it should be deallocated
    - Memory space is made available
- Otherwise, we will eventually run out of memory

    ```go
    func f() {
    	var x = 4
    	fmt. Printf("%d", X)
    }
    ```

- Each call `f()` creates an integer

**Stack vs. Heap**

- Stack is dedicated to function calls
    - Local variables are stored here
    - Deallocated after function completes
- Heap is persistent

**Manual Deallocation**

- Data on the heap must be deallocated when it is done being used
- In most compiled languages (i.e. C), this is done manually
`X = malloc(32);
free (x) ;`
- Error-prone, but fast

**Garbage Collection**

- In interpreted languages, this is done by the interpreter
    - Java Virtual Machine
    - Python Interpreter
- Easy for the programmer
- Slow (need an interpreter)

**Garbage Collection in Go**

- Go is a compiled language which enables garbage collection
- Implementation is fast
- Compiler determines stack vs heap
- Garbage collection in the background

**Strings**

- Sequence of arbitrary bytes
    - Read-only
    - Often meant to be printed
- String literal - notated by double quotes
`X := "Hi there"`
- Each byte is a rune (UTF-8 code point)
